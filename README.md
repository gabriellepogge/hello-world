# hello-world
A project to learn how to use Git and GitHub with R.

#learning all of the things about this awesome collaborative version-control tool!

#big day! made a GitHub account, installed git with the terminal, and connected git to R. yay!

#take two. trying to push changes to this file to github.
#we seem to be getting an error.
#we're silly; to get these local changes onto hitbut you "pull" and then "push" using Rstudio radio buttons not on github.
